# -totalitycorp-frontend-challenge
This Full Stack e-commerce SPA (single page application) has been created by me which uses React js at the client's side and firebase for the backend and deployment purposes. The project includes user authentication, user tracking, react routing, react hooks, react-context API, react dom manipulation, reusable components, react slick implementation, device responsiveness, dummy payment gateway API integration and the SPA's deployment on Firebase.

Dependencies used:
-> npm (Node's packet manager)

-> create-react-app (for default react js project setup)

-> react-dom

-> react-router-dom (for implementing SPA's page routing without page refresh)

-> react-slick (for implementing slick carousel)

-> react-currency-format (to standardize the calculated price of the total items)

-> react-stripe-checkout (to implement a dummy payment gateway API's integration)

-> material-core

-> material-ui (icon components)

-> firebase (for user authentication and tracking purposes and hosting the web app)
